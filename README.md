EX18 - Daytona Aquarium

**Gherkin Scenarios**

This project collects the Gherkin scenarios that the EX18 externship is writing for the Daytona Aquarium & Rainforest Adventure Web site.

Gherkin uses the *Given-When-Then* syntax to identify steps that a user (or automated test) takes in a test and what expected result should occur.

For example:  
**Given** I am on the contact us form  
**When** I enter a first name in the First Name edit box  
**And** I click the Submit button  
**Then** I should see the Please fill out this field validation message on the Last Name edit box
